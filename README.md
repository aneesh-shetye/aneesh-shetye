## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
<br>
I'm a second year Masters student at NYU, studying Computer Engineering, working at the intersection of RL and NLP. Previously, I have worked with multimodality, multilingualism, and contrastive learning.

## What can you expect to find here? 
You would probably find repositories which benchmark various datasets and models. Other repositories contain precursor experiments to major projects. However, most of my work can be found on GitHub accounts for the respective labs and organizations- [IvLabs](https://github.com/IvLabs), [EMERGE Lab](https://github.com/Emerge-Lab) and [Sov.ai](https://github.com/sovai-research/news-llm-project).
